# Twitter API Billing Issue - @DeployOnKlik

## Account Information
- Twitter Handle: @DeployOnKlik
- User ID: 1926764279207731200

## Issue Summary
I am paying $200/month for Twitter API Basic tier but my account is limited to FREE tier restrictions.

## Evidence

### 1. Current Billing Status
- Subscription: Basic Tier
- Monthly Cost: $200
- Billing Status: Active/Paid

### 2. Actual API Access
```
üë§ USER Daily Limit: 100 tweets/day
   ‚ùå This is FREE TIER (should be 3,000/month for Basic)
```

### 3. API Response Headers
When attempting to post via v2 API:
```
x-user-limit-24hour-limit: 100
x-user-limit-24hour-remaining: 0
```

### 4. Expected vs Actual Limits

| Feature | Basic Tier (Paid) | What I'm Getting |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Monthly Tweets | 3,000 per user | 100 per day (~3,000/month) |
| Daily Hard Limit | None | 100 (FREE tier) |
| v1.1 API Access | Full | Limited |
| Monthly Cost | $200 | $200 (but FREE access) |

## Apps Tested
1. DeployOnKlik (original app)
2. DeployOnKlik2 (created new)
3. [New app created today] - API Key: NhkMcB5Wgt9Ij9ZcTR8gEIoeV

All apps show the same FREE tier limits.

## Request
Please apply my paid Basic tier subscription to my @DeployOnKlik account. I should have:
- 3,000 tweets/month per user
- 50,000 tweets/month per app
- Full v1.1 and v2 API access
- No 100/day hard limit

## Test Results
Full test results available showing FREE tier limits despite Basic subscription.

Thank you for your assistance.
