# Changelog - Klik Token Deployer

All notable changes to the Klik Token Deployer bot system will be documented in this file.

## [V3.0] - 2025-01-03

### üí∞ Self-Claim Fees System

#### New Feature: Fee Capture Choice
- **Verified users can now choose**: Community fee split OR self-claim fees
- **Default behavior**: Unchanged - fees still fund community buybacks
- **Self-claim mode**: Users get 50% of fees from their token deployments
- **Maintains buybacks**: 25% source token + 25% $DOK buybacks still happen

#### How It Works
- **Automated integration**: Works with existing `test_fee_detection.py` system
- **Smart detection**: System checks deployer preferences for each fee
- **No manual work**: Fully automated based on user settings
- **Backwards compatible**: Existing system unchanged

#### User Interface (Telegram Bot)
- **Fee Settings menu**: Toggle self-claim on/off
- **Claimable fees view**: See accumulated fees from deployments  
- **Simple controls**: One-click toggle between modes
- **Real-time stats**: Track total claimed and available amounts

#### Security Requirements
- **Twitter verification required**: Only verified accounts can self-claim
- **Wallet verification required**: Must have deposited from registered wallet
- **Prevents exploitation**: Unverified users default to community split
- **Secure preferences**: Settings stored safely in database

#### Database Updates
- **New tables**: `user_fee_settings`, `deployment_fees`
- **Fee tracking**: Records claimable amounts per user per token
- **Migration script**: `migrate_self_claim_fees.py` for safe updates
- **Full compatibility**: All existing data preserved

#### Benefits
- **User choice**: Community support OR personal profit
- **Transparency**: Users see exactly what they earn
- **Security**: Multiple verification layers
- **Platform growth**: Incentivizes verification and engagement

## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-27

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Anti-Abuse Features

#### DOK Ticker Protection

- **New System**: Smart progressive cooldowns based on usage patterns:
  - 1st deployment: Always allowed ‚úÖ

## Deposit System Update - June 27, 2025

### Problem
Users reported deposits not being credited automatically, requiring manual intervention.

### Solution
Implemented robust deposit monitoring using Alchemy Transfers API:

1. **Automatic Monitoring**: 
   - Checks for deposits every 30 seconds
   - Processes deposits automatically with notifications
   - Tracks last checked block to avoid missing transactions

2. **Manual Check Enhancement**:
   - Now checks ENTIRE transaction history (not just 24 hours)
   - Users can claim ANY historical deposits via "Check Deposits" button
   - Shows summary of transfers found, already credited, and invalid amounts

3. **Support Tools**:
   - Added `/credit_tx <tx_hash>` command for manual crediting
   - Validates transaction before crediting to prevent errors

4. **Security**:
   - 3 block confirmation requirement
   - Transaction hash tracking prevents double-crediting
   - Only registered wallets can be credited

### Impact
- Users get credited within 30 seconds automatically
- No more lost deposits
- Support can manually credit edge cases if needed
