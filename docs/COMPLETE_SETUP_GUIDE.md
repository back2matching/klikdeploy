# Complete Setup Guide - Klik Token Deployer

## What This System Does

Users tweet `@DeployOnKlik $TOKEN` → Bot deploys tokens on Ethereum in 1-3 seconds

- **FREE** when gas ≤ 3 gwei (~1/week limit, 1500+ followers)
- **PAID** when gas > 3 gwei (deposit ETH first)
- **$DOK HOLDERS** get 3 free deploys/week with NO FEES (5M+ DOK)

## Quick Start - Run Both Bots Together

### Single Terminal (Recommended)
```bash
python run_both.py
```
This runs both bots in ONE terminal with color-coded output:
- 🔵 Blue = Twitter bot messages
- 🟢 Green = Telegram bot messages

### Separate Terminals
```bash
# Terminal 1
python klik_token_deployer.py

# Terminal 2 (optional)
python telegram_deposit_bot.py
```

## How The System Works

### Free Deployment Limits (NEW - More Restrictive!)

To prevent abuse and reduce gas waste, free deployments are now LIMITED:

- **1st free deploy in 7 days**: ✅ Allowed
- **2nd free deploy within 7 days**: ❌ 30-day cooldown applied
- **Back-to-back deploys**: ❌ 14-day cooldown applied

**Effectively: You get ~1 free deployment per week**

Want more deployments? Either:
1. **Become a $DOK holder** (5M+ tokens) → 2 free/week up to 15 gwei
2. **Use pay-per-deploy** → Deposit ETH for unlimited deployments

### For New Users

1. **Tweet at the bot**
   ```
   @user: @DeployOnKlik $MEME
   Bot: ❌ Gas too high! DM @DeployOnKlikBot on Telegram
   ```

2. **Open Telegram bot**
   - Search for @DeployOnKlikBot
   - Press START
   - Click "🔗 Link Twitter Account"
   - Enter: `/link yourusername`

3. **Register wallet**
   - Click "💳 Register Wallet"
   - Enter: `/wallet 0x123...`
   - ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST send ETH from THIS wallet!

4. **Deposit ETH**
   - Click "📥 Deposit"
   - Send 0.03-1 ETH to bot wallet FROM your registered wallet
   - Click "🔄 Check for Deposits"
   - Bot credits your account instantly

5. **Deploy tokens**
   - Tweet again: `@DeployOnKlik $MEME`
   - Bot deploys and deducts from balance

6. **Withdraw anytime**
   - Click "📤 Withdraw" 
   - Confirm withdrawal of FULL balance
   - ETH sent to your wallet automatically!
   - Note: Only full balance withdrawals supported (no partial)

## Telegram Bot Setup

### 1. Bot Already Created!

Your bot is ready at: **@DeployOnKlikBot**
Token is already in `.env`: `7896903262:AAG_qEn6LsG04ZYA2mUsgSBZbagTkEkuPXc`

**Note**: The Twitter bot username is currently set to `mlquantlab` in .env for testing. Change `BOT_USERNAME` to `DeployOnKlik` for production.

### 2. Just Run It!

```bash
python telegram_deposit_bot.py
# or
python run_both.py  # To run both bots together
```

That's it! No need to create a bot or get tokens - it's all set up.

## Why Users Must Register Their Wallet

The bot needs to know which wallet belongs to which user. When you:
1. Register wallet: `0x123...`
2. Send ETH FROM that wallet
3. Bot sees: "Oh, 0x123... sent money, that's @username's wallet"
4. Credits your account

If you send from a different wallet, the bot won't know it's you!

## Telegram Bot Features

- 💰 **Your Balance** - Current ETH balance

### Buttons

## How Deposits Work

1. **User sends ETH** from registered wallet
2. **Clicks "Check for Deposits"** button
3. **Bot uses Alchemy** to find transfers
4. **Credits account** instantly

No manual TX hash needed! The bot checks the blockchain directly.
