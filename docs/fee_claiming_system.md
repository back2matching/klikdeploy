# Klik Finance Fee Claiming System v1.02

## Overview

The automated fee claiming system implements the v1.02 flywheel mechanics for the Deploy On Klik bot:

- **25%** of claimed fees â†’ Automatic DOK buyback & burn
- **25%** of claimed fees â†’ Reserved for future incentives
- **50%** of claimed fees â†’ Bot owner revenue

## Features

### 1. Balance Segregation
The system tracks different balance sources separately to ensure proper fund management:

- **User Deposits**: Protected, only used for user's own deployments
- **Earned Fees**: Protected, belongs to bot owner from fee claims
- **Platform Fees**: Protected, 0.01 ETH fees from pay-per-deploy users
- **Original Funding**: Used for free deployments only

### 2. Fee Claiming Interface

#### Via Telegram Bot UI:
1. Click "ðŸ’Ž Claim Fees" button (bot owner only)
2. Select a token from the list
3. View claimable amount with automatic splits
4. Confirm to execute claim and buyback

#### Via Manual Command:
```
/claim <token_address>
```

Example:
```
/claim 0x69ca61398eCa94D880393522C1Ef5c3D8c058837
```

### 3. Automatic Buyback Process

When fees are claimed:
1. Smart contract sends ETH to bot wallet
2. Bot calculates 25% for buyback
3. Executes swap on Uniswap V2: ETH â†’ DOK
4. Sends DOK directly to burn address (0x000...dead)
5. Records transaction details in database

## Database Schema

### fee_claims
Tracks all fee claim transactions:
- `token_address`: Token contract address
- `claimed_amount`: Total ETH claimed
- `buyback_amount`: 25% for buyback
- `incentive_amount`: 25% for incentives
- `dev_amount`: 50% for developer
- `claim_tx_hash`: Claim transaction hash
- `buyback_tx_hash`: Buyback transaction hash
- `buyback_dok_amount`: DOK tokens burned

### balance_sources
Segregates balance by source:
- `source_type`: 'deposit', 'fee_claim', 'pay_per_deploy'
- `amount`: ETH amount
- `tx_hash`: Related transaction
- `description`: Human-readable description

## Security Features

1. **Owner-Only Access**: Only bot owner (@deployonklik) can claim fees
2. **Balance Protection**: Free deployments cannot use earned revenue
3. **Atomic Updates**: Database uses atomic operations to prevent race conditions
4. **Transaction Verification**: All claims and buybacks are verified on-chain

## Configuration

The system uses these contract addresses:
- **Klik Factory**: `0x930f9FA91E1E46d8e44abC3517E2965C6F9c4763`
- **DOK Token**: `0x69ca61398eCa94D880393522C1Ef5c3D8c058837`
- **Uniswap V2 Router**: `0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D`

## Testing

Use the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_fee_claim.py
```

Options:
1. Test fee claim for DOK token
2. Simulate fee claim for custom token
3. Check all recent pools

## How It Works

### Fee Claiming Process
1. Bot owner uses `/claim <token_address>` or clicks "ðŸ’Ž Claim Fees" button
2. System finds the tokenId for the given token address
3. Calls `collectFees(tokenId)` on the Klik Factory contract
4. Factory transfers accumulated fees (DOK + ETH) to the bot wallet
5. System automatically:
   - Sends 25% of ETH to buyback DOK and burn it
   - Reserves 25% for incentives
   - Credits 50% to bot owner's revenue

### Token Address to TokenId Mapping

Klik Finance uses a tokenId system where each pool has a unique index in the `allPairs` array. When you enter a token address (like DOK), the system needs to find which tokenId corresponds to that token's pool.

**Example**: DOK (0x69ca61398eCa94D880393522C1Ef5c3D8c058837) has tokenId 1018175

The system uses several methods to find the tokenId:
1. **Known Mappings**: Common tokens like DOK have hardcoded tokenIds for efficiency
2. **Alchemy API Search**: Uses enhanced APIs to find pool creation events
3. **Fallback Search**: Iterates through the allPairs array to find the token

### V1.02 Flywheel Mechanics

The 25% automatic buyback creates constant buying pressure on DOK, while burning reduces supply. This creates a positive feedback loop where:
1. More deployments â†’ More fees
2. More fees â†’ More buybacks
3. More buybacks â†’ Higher DOK price
4. Higher DOK price â†’ More incentive to hold DOK
5. More DOK holders â†’ More deployments

## Fee Simulation

The system includes a simulation feature to check claimable fees before executing:

### How Simulation Works

The system uses Alchemy's powerful `simulateAssetChanges` API to get exact fee amounts:

1. **Asset Change Simulation**: Simulates the transaction and returns all asset transfers
2. **Exact Amounts**: Shows precise ETH and DOK amounts that would be received
3. **Gas Estimation**: Provides accurate gas usage estimates
4. **No Execution**: Completely safe - only simulates without executing

### Simulation Benefits

Using `simulateAssetChanges` provides:
- **Exact ETH Amount**: See precisely how much ETH would be claimed
- **Token Transfers**: Also shows any DOK tokens that would be transferred
- **Gas Usage**: Accurate gas estimates for budgeting
- **Error Detection**: Identifies if fees exist before attempting to claim

### Using Simulation

**Via Telegram Bot:**
- The bot automatically simulates before showing the claim interface
- Shows exact ETH and DOK amounts that would be received
- Displays the v1.02 distribution breakdown

**Via Command Line:**
```bash
python test_fee_claim.py
# Choose option 2 to simulate any token
```

**Programmatically:**
```python
from klik_factory_interface import simulate_fee_claim

result = await simulate_fee_claim("0x69ca61398eCa94D880393522C1Ef5c3D8c058837")
if result['success']:
    if result['claimable_eth'] > 0:
        print(f"Claimable: {result['claimable_eth']} ETH")
        print(f"DOK tokens: {result.get('claimable_dok', 0)} DOK")
        print(f"Gas required: {result.get('gas_used', 'Unknown')}")
    else:
        print("No fees available to claim")
```

### Fallback Behavior

If Alchemy's `simulateAssetChanges` is not available, the system falls back to:
- Gas estimation to detect if fees exist
- Cannot determine exact amounts without the enhanced API
- Still prevents failed transactions by checking if claim would succeed

## Important Notes

1. **No View Function**: Klik Factory doesn't have a view function for claimable fees. The system uses Alchemy's `simulateAssetChanges` to simulate the claim and show exact amounts.

2. **Token ID Mapping**: The factory uses token IDs (array indices) rather than direct token addresses. The system searches through the `allPairs` array to find the correct ID.

3. **Buyback Slippage**: Set to 3% by default to handle price fluctuations during the swap.

4. **Gas Buffer**: All transactions use a 10-20% gas buffer to ensure successful execution.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Price Oracle**: Integrate Chainlink or similar for accurate DOK pricing
2. **Multi-DEX Support**: Check multiple DEXs for best execution price
3. **Batch Claims**: Claim fees from multiple tokens in one transaction
4. **Incentive Distribution**: Automated system for the 25% incentive allocation
